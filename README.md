## Unmaintained Plugins (Unavailable)

We also maintain old plugin repos that are no longer needed since they are now published from a new repository. These are listed here, but they do not need a new owner.

## Abandon Plugin
If for any reason you can no longer maintain a plugin, please consider transferring it to our [unmaintained plugins](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/Info) repo. We can take ownership until another willing developer comes along. Submit a request [here](https://github.com/homebridge/unmaintained-plugins/issues/new?assignees=Homebridge+Collaborators&labels=pending-review&template=abandon.md&title=Request+to+Abandon+Plugin) so that transfer of ownership can be given to us on both GitHub and on NPM.
